# Graph SC

This on-going project is exploring how GCNs can learn from stem cell microscopy imaging.

Most of the code is run on Brown's Oscar CCV compute cluster using Slurm, as defined by the `.sh` files in the repo.

This particular repository was forked from an older repository, whose work I inherited and significantly expanded upon.
